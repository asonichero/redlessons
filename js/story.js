// Little Red’s Lessons — the story's conversations, as scripts for js/talk.js. Speakers: 'red' (Rose: Red to her mother, her grandmother and Peter; Little
// Red in her cloak), 'mother' (Maren, whom Rose only ever calls Mama) and 'gran' (Hulda, her grandmother). Faces are js/toon.js's expressions: calm, smile, shy, cheeky, pout,
// stern, surprised, wince, gritted, crying.
//
// Chapter one, the homecoming: Red comes in late in the dusk from her grandmother's, through the wood, in the new red cloak her grandmother made
// her, and morose. Her mother sees it at once. (A first draft: the beats are the ones agreed; the words are for tuning.)
